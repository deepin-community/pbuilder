  * modules:
    + Set the debconf value for man-db/auto-update to false to save time in
      the package installing phase.  Nobody is going to need a refreshed
      man-db in a build chroot.
  * pdebuild:
    + With --auto-debsign try to sign both _${arch}.changes and
      _source.changes if available.  Closes: #932743
  * buildpackage:
    + Allow resolving the local hostname too.
  * bash-completion:
    + Add --binary-indep to the completion.  Closes: #951158
  * e/D65various-compiler-support:
    + shellcheck improvements.
  * pbuilderrc:

    + Fix parsing of build profiles when there is a << version restriction
      before the build profile marker.  Closes: #961227
      Thanks to Helmut Grohne for the initial patch.
  * autopkgtest:
    + Replace deprecated ADTTMP variable with AUTOPKGTEST_TMP.
    + Properly use of `tr` to lowercase strings.
    + Only delete the temporary directory when not running through autopkgtest.
    + Stop explicitly requiring the archive signing key, since that is very
      likely to already be installed anyway.  This will fix the autopkgtest in
      Debian testing where ubuntu-archive-keyring is not available anymore
      (and never needed anyway).

      This will happen regardless of the Debian version of the chroot and the

  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Add an APT based resolver.  Closes: #707825
    This is named pbuilder-satisfydepends-apt; it requires apt >= 1.2.2 inside
    the chroot to work, otherwise it'll just fail.  I recommend moving to this
    instead of any other for those who can (probably the default will change at
    some point in the future, after the stretch release).
  * Add initial cross build support.  Closes: #801799
    + Add a new --host-arch command line option (setting non-public HOST_ARCH
      variable) to set the *host* architecture; if not specified it defaults to
      the build architecture.
    + --architecture/ARCHITECTURE is used to specify the *build* architecture;
      it defaults to the architecture of the host as reported by dpkg.
    + Some automatic setup is done to allow cross building (at `build` time):
      - the host architecture is added to dpkg's list of architectures;
      - crossbuild-essential-$HOST_ARCH, libc-dev:$HOST_ARCH and
        libstdc++-6-dev:$HOST_ARCH are preinstalled (the latter two due to
        bug #815172 in build-essential);
      - `--host-arch $HOST_ARCH` is passed to dpkg-buildpackage;
      - 'nocheck' is added to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS;
      - 'nocheck cross' is added to DEB_BUILD_PROFILES.
    + A new --no-auto-cross can be used to override partially or all of the
      above automatism; see pbuilder(8) for more.
    + The dependency statisfiers now receive BUILD_ARCH and HOST_ARCH variables
      (through --(host|build)-arch options used when call them).
    + The only dependency satisfier allowed when cross building is the APT one,
      as that's the only one supporting --host-arch at the moment.
    This implementation is still *experimental*, details may vary across the
    next releases, especially the part relative to what's is automatically done.
  * buildpackage:
    + copy the source into the chroot before satisfying the build-deps.
      This allows for very easy use of `apt-get build-dep`.

  * loadconfig:
    + be more honest about why it's not possible to load a conf file, instead
      of just saying "it doesn't exist".  Also, fail in case the file exists,

  * modules: add_additional_aptkeyrings:
    Copy keyrings to /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d instead of using apt-key.
    We can no longer rely on being able to use apt-key in a minimal chroot,
    because gnupg has been demoted to a Recommends in apt. Instead, the
    keyrings can be copied directly into /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d.
    Moreover, `apt-key` usage has been discuraged over the past years.
    This means that using the APTKEYRINGS option of pbuilder won't actually
    work with chroots older than squeeze (APT version 0.7.25.1)

  * modules:
    + term_supports_colors: properly deal with tput not detecting a
      colored-capable terminal (as within cron).  Closes: #837202
    + add_additional_aptkeyrings: don't fail if the target keyring file is
      already presetn, just warn if different.
  * pbuilder.8, pbuilderrc.5: properly format so that no extra space is right
    before a closing bracket.

    For now only debug, warning and error messages are coloured respectively in

  * debian/tests/build-procenv: change debian mirror to cloudfront.debian.net,
    it's allegedly better for ci.debian.net.
  * debian/gbp.conf: change the format of the tags, use only '%(version)s'.
  * Kill pdebuild-user-mode-linux too, uml is already gone, these are just
    stale files.
  * Make the copyright notices uniform across the codebase.
  * Add support for building architecture-independent binaries only with the
    new option "--binary-indep".
    This option instructs pbuilder to install only 'Build-Depends' and

    + Make BUILDDIR available to hooks, so they can know where the source and
      the built packages are.
    + Add a symlink from /tmp/buildd to the current BUILDD to avoid too many
      breakages.  This change will go away someday, so please update your
      scripts to use BUILDDIR.  The link will be created only if /tmp/buildd is
      an empty directory (what everybody should have now) or a non-existing
      (new chroot created from this version).

    + Use BUILDDIR instead of hardcoding /tmp/buildd on hooks examples.
    + pbuilder.8: remove architecture examples for --architecture. It simply
      supports whatever debootstrap support, no point in listing them.
      Thanks to Reiner Herrmann for poiting this out.
    + Explain that the documentation is work in progress and as such incomplete
      and outdated.
    + Finish German translation and refresh translations files.

  * "Fixing the personal side of the pbuilder", release

    it was set to "nobody@nowhere", but that shouldn't be necessary.
    (closes: #136628, #137411)
  * pbuilderrc: change the default config so that binary and source is built
  * ignore build-depends in package lines and only use those found in the
    source lines.
  * debian/TODO: updated.
  * pbuilder-satisfydepends: split out the dependency satisfaction
    code, so that it can be used genericly. Or replaced with other
    programs, such as sbuild. However, sbuild reads .dsc files, while
    pbuilder parses debian/control.
  * fixed regexp for multi-line build-*: field processing.

    source packages inside the chroot, on build target.

    so that in most cases it will be cleaned. In some conditions, temp
    file will still remain, but really, there is not much atomicity in shell?
  * pbuilder.1 typo fixed.

  * debian/TODO: updated - notes on apt-move archives, and other things.
  * debian/control: updated the dependency requirement of
    debootstrap (>= 0.1.15.5) see bug #126458 for a consequence.
  * debian/README.Debian: updated the testsuite info, and some descriptions
    are rewritten.

  * pbuilder-modules: no longer includes "deb-src" lines in the apt config.
    Source is not required at all by pbuilder. Some message cleanup.

pbuilder (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

    It will search for ../debian directory, in addition to ./debian,
    and also to recurse upwards.
  * updated manpage for pdebuild.1

pbuilder (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

    (closes: #124192), it really should not be there.
    The original debian/control is left as debian/control.test,
    so that testing can be done easily, by cp debian/control{.test,}

pbuilder (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * The last version had a typo... bug 120057 was the one to close, not
    12057 :P
  * A hook to check the current command-line operation, and
    not to do the "exec < /dev/null" when it is trying to do
    "login" is implemented, so that it is actually possible to
    log in with noninteractive mode enabled. At the request of
    steven.robbins@videotron.ca (closes: #120064)
  * Check for failures in umounting proc, and retry with a little
    wait to see if something happens.
    Will start up a command-line if something fails, and ask for
    some remedy.
  * It will now parse debian/control file with multi-line
    Build-Depends line or Build-Conflicts line (closes: #120718)
    However, I don't think the policy really permits this very clearly.
    There are packages which exist doing this, and other tools do support this.
  * --logfile option added. Log file can now be specified.
  * fixed pbuilder.1, and pbuilderrc.5 so that it can be processed
    correctly by WoMan. (removed some .PP)
    and fixed some awkwardness in text.
  * Added some error checking to pbuilder-buildpackage to give more
    information when base.tgz has not been created (yet).

pbuilder (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixing some minor glitch. pdebuild should be calling dpkg-buildpackage with
    -us -uc.
  * changed pdebuild logic in obtaining version number, from using
    grep/cut to sed.
  * fixed build-conflicts logic. It failed when build-conflicted target did not
    already exist inside chroot.
  * README.Debian is updated.
  * Added a nonexistent package to Build-Conflicts of debian/control, so that
    it will be possible to catch such possible error.
  * patch from fbiere@abacom.com, fixes build-dependency with
    OR conditions. It used to try out all. (closes: #119541)
  * Redundant "case" removed from pbuilder-createbasetgz.
    (it was introduced in 0.10).
    Thanks go to Steve for pointing this out.
    (closes: #12057)
  * Fixed the reverse-logic for the "distribution is not specified"

pbuilder (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch for full non-interactive compilation by
    Daniel Kobras (kobras@debian.org) applied. (closes: #116891)
    However, note that doing this will result in "pbuilder login" being very
    uninteresting.
  * Depends on gcc, because debootstrap does not seem to function well
    without gcc. Actually, dpkg does not work without gcc, when it is asked
    questions about the "architecture."
  * Now dpkg-buildpackage is invoked with DEBEMAIL as maintainer.
    It can be overridden with command line option. To build it like :
     dpkg-buildpackage -mdancer@debian.org"
    the command-line would be like:
     pbuiler build --debemail dancer@debian.org package.dsc
  * dpkg-buildpackage is being called with -us -uc
  * site local /etc/passwd is no longer copied to inside chroot.
    Copying of that file was never really required, as it seems.
  * use "set -e" at the beginning of shell scripts.
    It should work fine.
  * "cleaning the build env" message is prepended with ->
  * error state for cp for finished work in pbuilder-buildpackage
    is now ignored. (to work with set -e)
  * full non-interactive compilation patch, moved over to
    pbuilder-modules, so that build/update/create all benefit from this.
  * cleans build place on debootstrap failure.
  * A new command "pdebuild" is introduced. It can be invoked
    from a Debian source tree, and builds the package within a chroot
    after gaining root privilages appropriately.
  * added recommends: for fakeroot and sudo, since pdebuild requires
    them.

pbuilder (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * allow use of hardlinks in apt cache handling, with new option
    APTCACHEHARDLINK. This cannot be enabled if pbuilder
    files are distributed among filesystems.
    It should speed up processing.
  * Depends on wget, since debootstrap only recommends, and I think this
    program is not quite functional as it is without wget
  * fix runhook breakage introduced by my hacking around with quotes.
  * Make runhook work as advertized in pbuilder.1 manpage. (closes: #116416)
  * added DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive to the config file. This
    suppresses debconf questions.

pbuilder (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * support custom debootstrap scripts, requested by amon@vnl.com
    (closes: #114691)
  * changed hook handler. hopefully it should work if the directory is
    not called a hookdir ...
  * changed "hooks" variable in pbuilder-runhooks, to not to have
    a starting "/". It should be unnecessary
  * E: messages in pbuilder-runhooks are now "W:" messages, because
    even when those errors are detected, they should not really
    stop the execution of pbuilder halfway.

    o Wrote pbuilder-runhooks and integrated it into the create and
      update scripts.
    o Added HOOKDIR to configuration options
    o Added --hookdir to command line options
     Updated man pages for pbuilder and pbuilderrc
    o Added defaulting/error checks of a couple key variables in
      pbuilder-checkparams.
    o Added /usr/lib/pbuilder/hooks default hook directory to debian/dirs

    oo  Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Wed, 26 Sep 2001 23:49:00 +0001
  * when HOOKDIR is not set, scripts won't be ran.
    It is a security risk to be able to run any random script as
    root, so be aware of this when setting "HOOKDIR".
  * debian/control: removed ${shlibs:Depends}, because there is none.
  * fixing logic error in updatebuildenv.
  * removed pushd and popd from runhooks, just because
    I don't think it looks cute.
  * updated README file, to have some contents
  * Added displaying what's copied in build target, parsing of .dsc.
    and changed pbuilder-buildpackage .dsc parser.
    It used to catch a bogus entry, something like  "./",
    which is now fixed.

pbuilder (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a man page for /etc/pbuilderrc configuration file.
    Should help people understand what is going on...
  * Added a feature of caching the contents of /var/cache/apt/archives
    inside the chroot. It's not quite apt-move, but this should do the
    trick ?
  * pbuilder clean will clean the apt cache.
  * REMOVEPACKAGES is a configurable option now.
    Please be warned, if you are upgrading, that "lilo" might be left
    on your chroot, which could potentially cause nasty damage.
  * added /var/cache/pbuilder/aptcache directory
  * A bug with .dsc file parser which caused some annoying error messages

    not accept a "period" in the debian version number. strange.
  * depend on debootstrap 0.1.15 or greater. Because it has been tested on
    0.1.15
  * includes an internal checkbuilddep to support potato.
  Internal build-dependency checker is used instead of dpkg-checkbuilddeps.
  * does no longer copy the /etc/apt directory into the chroot. It should be
    non-necessary.
  * added a clean target to pbuilder program to clean up cruft.
  * removed the debian-changelog-mode thing at the bottom of the changelog.
  * added login target to pbuilder, to allow for easy debugging.
  * fixed typo in apt-line generation
  * added an or-sign for build-dependency internal checker, and moving
    over fully to the internal checker. Build dep checker does not support
    a Build depends with an or sign and a machine specification.
    Also it ignores the version preference.
  * change priority to extra, because it depends on an extra package.
    thanks to mechanix.
  * added non-us mirror and other mirror options
