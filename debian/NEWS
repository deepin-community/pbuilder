pbuilder (0.228) unstable; urgency=medium

  Pbuilder changes its behavior regarding SHM handling: it'll now mount a
  tmpfs in /dev/shm and set /run/shm as a symbolic link to the former.
  Also the USERUNSHM variable is deprecated in favour of USESHM (but any
  definition of the former will override the latter).
  This will happen regardless of the Debian version of the chroot and the
  architecture used, as it ought to be harmless if unused.  Administrators
  are suggested to drop any workarounds in place to overcome this deficiency
  in pbuilder, such as bind-mounting /dev/shm from the host, to avoid
  situations like over-mounting.

  Pdebuild  will no longer generate a source changes file
  if BUILDRESULT is the parent directory, since the dsc will be overwritten
  when copying back the build results, possibly invalidating the previous
  changes file; please use pbuilder's new --source-only-changes option.

pbuilder (0.224) unstable; urgency=medium

  Pbuilder won't set 'APT::Default-Release = "experimental"' for experimental
  chroots anymore.

  This caused it to download all packages from experimental, not only those
  needed to satisfy Build-Depends, often causing more troubles than anything
  else.
  This makes pbuilder behaves more similar to Debian's buildds, and aligns its
  behaviour with all the other partial overlay suites (like *-backports).
  This also means that starting from now packages needing binaries from
  experimental will need to mark the Build-Depedency with a version constriction
  (but this is most likely a non-issue, given that this is already needed for
  packages meant to be uploaded to the Debian archive).

pbuilder (0.216) experimental; urgency=medium

  The default build directory has been moved from /tmp/buildd to /build.
  This both prevents tempering with /tmp (which is normally world-writable, and
  as such a user could create the directory before pbuilder and thus owning it,
  and then it could temper with the build process).  See #789404 for more info.
  Also this align pbuilder's behaviour to sbuild's making produced builds more
  similar (and thus helping the reproducible builds effort).

  Please update your hook scripts to use the new directory or change it back
  (discouraged) by setting the BUILDDIR configure option.

pbuilder (0.207) unstable; urgency=low

  The default configuration will now only install trusted packages.  This
  prevents building packages with manipulated sources or a system compromise
  due to a man-in-the-middle attack.

  However this also prevents installing packages from unsigned repositories by
  default.

  If you really want to continue using unsigned repositories, you have to set
  ALLOWUNTRUSTED=yes in your .pbuilderrc or use the --allow-untrusted option.
  But if possible use a signed repository and set the used keys with the new
  --keyring option (can be passed multiple times).

  Due to this change the PBUILDERSATISFYDEPENDSOPT option --check-key is no
  longer necessary and thus deprecated.

pbuilder (0.197) unstable; urgency=low

  The default configuration will now enable ccache.  To disable installation
  and usage of ccache in pbuilder, unset CCACHEDIR in your pbuilderrc.

pbuilder (0.195) unstable; urgency=low

  --debbuildopts is now additive and will append to pbuilderrc's
  DEBBUILDOPTS.  To reset the list of options, pass --debbuildopts "".

  The default debootstrap command is now "debootstrap" instead of
  "cdebootstrap"; cdebootstrap is still supported, but you might have to set
  DEBOOTSTRAP="cdebootstrap" in your pbuilderrc or pass
  --debootstrap=cdebootstrap to use it.  Custom cdebootstrap options set via
  DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS or --debootstrapopts might not be compatible with
  debootstrap.

  The default PBUILDERROOTCMD is now "sudo -E" instead of "sudo"; this allows
  passing env vars for pbuilderrc expansion or to the build process such as
  DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
